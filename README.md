# 👋 Hello! I'm Blake Fealy

I'm a Post-Production Supervisor, Video Editor, and Motion Graphics Designer based in Portland, OR. I specialize in creating polished, engaging content—while also building custom scripts and extensions that make life easier for motion designers.

With experience working for companies like Microsoft, I’ve developed both internal tools and publicly released extensions that automate repetitive tasks and add missing functionality to Adobe apps—especially After Effects.

### ⚙️ Building Tools & Extensions

I enjoy building tools that streamline workflows and eliminate repetitive tasks. From internal automation tools for companies like Microsoft to custom CEP extensions for After Effects, my focus is always on solving real-world problems. I’ve also developed libraries of scripts that reduce manual work and improve efficiency for motion designers. Whether it’s simplifying complex processes or adding missing functionality, I create tools that save time and just work.
